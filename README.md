# Track_maintain
This project aims to address a problem faced by my friend who installs Water Filtration Systems. The maintenance of these systems becomes challenging with a large number of customers. This project serves as an opportunity for me to solve this problem while learning C#.

# Context
My friend's business involves the installation of Water Filtration Systems, which require regular maintenance. However, managing maintenance schedules becomes overwhelming with a growing customer base. This project is an attempt to develop a solution to track and manage maintenance tasks efficiently.
